Program 2 : Create Data frames using R Programming

AIM:
To create data frames using R programming.
Algorithm:
Step 1: Start the process.
Step 2: Open RStudio and open a new file.
Step 3: Select “Source on Save” check box on the toolbar.
Step 4: Declare the variable.
Step 5: Use dataframe function to list items as table.
Step 6: Use $ symbol to list a particular column.
Step 7: Copy the code & paste it in the Console and run it.
Step 8: Save the file
Step 9: Stop the process.

Coding:

data.frame(fruit_name = c("apple", "banana","orange"), fruit_cost =
c(100,50,75), fruit_color = c("red", " yellow", "orange"), fruit_city =
c("J&K", "Maharashtra", "Tamilnadu") ) -> fruit
View(fruit)
fruit$fruit_name
fruit$fruit_cost
fruit$fruit_color
fruit$fruit_city
fruit$fruit_name[2]
fruit$fruit_city[3]
summary(fruit)
fruit$fruit_benefit <- c("v-A", "V-C", "V-C")
data.frame(fruit_name = c("cherry", "strawberry","Pineapple"),
fruit_cost = c(100,250,70), fruit_color = c("red", " Purple", "Yellow"),
fruit_city = c("J&K", "Maharashtra", "Tamilnadu"), fruit_benefit =
c("V-A", "V-B", "V-C") ) -> fruit_new
View(fruit_new)
>fruit_final <- rbind(fruit, fruit_new)
>View(fruit_final)

Output:
data.frame(fruit_name = c("apple", "banana","orange"), fruit_cost =
c(100,50,75), fruit_color = c("red", " yellow", "orange"), fruit_city = c("J&K",
"Maharashtra", "Tamilnadu") ) -> fruit
View(fruit)
