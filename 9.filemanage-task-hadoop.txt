9. File management tasks in hadoop

Aim:
To demonstrate file management tasks in hadoop.

Algorithm:
Step 1: Start the process.
Step 2: Open Apache hadoop.
Step 3: To Create a new directory use mkdir.
Step 4: To check directories in hdfs using ls.
Step5: To copy localfile1 of the local file system to the Hadoop filesystem using
put.
Step 6: To copy the ‘test1’ file present in the local file system to the newDataFlair
directory of Hadoop using copyFromLocal.
Step 7: To copy the ‘testfile’ of the hadoop filesystem to the local file system using
get.
Step 8: To copy the ‘sample’ file present in the newDataFlair directory of HDFS to
the local file system using copyToLocal.
Step9: To move the DR1 directory to the DataFlair directory in HDFS using mv command.
Step10: To move the files or directories from the source to a destination within
HDFS using mv.
Step11: To copy the ‘file1’ present in newDataFlair directory in HDFS to the
dataflair directory of HDFS using cp.
Step12: Stop the process.

RESULT:
Thus the above commands executed successfully.
